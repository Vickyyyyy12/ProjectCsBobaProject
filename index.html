  <header> <h2> But Victoria, none of those things youve listed above seem to have anything to do with coding, so why learn now? </h2> </header>
  <body> Recently I have grown to love trying to learn new things, even if they are scary, so I decided to give coding a shot. I never thought I was smart enough for coding and thought it was too hard, but I've been trying to learn and I'm enjoying it so far. I hope to learn more and more with the help of this club and its members! </body>
